### Materials needed for Assembly

- 4 Tubes - 12mm OD(outside diameter) or 1/2 inch OD, can be any non-flexible material, we used acrylic tubes but aluminum would work well too

- 12 or more M5 bolts

- 12 or more m6 bolts  

- Tapping Screws for M5 and M6 bolts

- Equipment to Fasten bolts



### Pieces to Print

- 4x Camera Attachments 1 and 2 (or 2x Bruce's Horizontal and Vertical Mounts)

- 2x Joint Unthreaded Pairs

### Instructions 
-  Print all pieces
-  On all the screen attachments (Joints), thread the bolt holes (the smaller holes) with an M6 Screw Tap. On the Camera Attachment 1 or Bruce's mounts, not all the holes need to be bolted to save time, you can choose which you prefer to use and thread those with the M5 screw tap. 
- On Camera Attachment 2 or Bruce's Mounts, screw in the Realsense Cameras.
- Attach each of the Joints to the four corners of the screen using M6 bolts at the back. Make sure they are aligned for the rods to be placed correctly. Rods can be aligned so the horizontal or vertical sides are frontmost depending on the orientation of the Joints.
-  Thread the rods into the Joint holes, adding the camera attachments inbetween and fasten everything with bolts. The Joints use M6 bolts, and the camera attachments use M5 bolts. 
- If not using Bruce's mounts, adjust the cameras to the desired depth and rotation. Grooves cut into Camera Attachment 2 can help with orienting the cameras horizontally or vertically.
